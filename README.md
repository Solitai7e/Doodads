Doodads
=======

Random doodads I've made for myself, most of them part of
other larger projects that I will probably never finish.

More will be added as I see fit.

```
defer.hpp          - scope guards implemented with lambdas in C++, behaves identically
                     to scope(exit/success/failure) in D. C++17 and later only.
async-queue.ts     - a FIFO queue implemented as an async iterator
mutex.ts           - simple promise-based mutex
emustorage.user.js - Web Storage shim, used mostly as a workaround for sites
                     that break themselves in the absence of the real APIs.
iterutils.js       - a random selection of common list operations, designed
                     around iterators and generators instead of arrays.
geany/             - plugins for Geany, most of them workarounds for random annoyances.
```
